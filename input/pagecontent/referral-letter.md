This model is influenced by NHS England [Booking and Referral Standard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/booking-and-referral-standard) and [e-Referral Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service), it is designed to work with or without both services.
As part of the modelling process, both have been mapped to FHIR Form Definitions:



These represent data that needs to be captured for use with these services. This model also includes elements from NHS England [Data Dictionary and Model](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/) and [PRSB](https://theprsb.org/standards/#).
