<br clear="all">
<p class="figureTitle">eReferral and eDischarge Process</p> 
<br clear="all">

1. Referral Initiator
   - Start Event – The process begins. 
   - Complete Referral Form – The initiator fills out a referral form, possibly attaching a Referral Letter document. 
   - Submit [Referral Request [PCC-55]](I12.html)– The referral is sent electronically.
2. Referral Recipient
   - Receive Referral – The recipient receives and acknowledges the referral. 
   - Triage Referral – The referral is reviewed for appropriateness.
   - Decision: Accept or Reject [Tasking Conversation](tasking.html)
     - If rejected, a Reject message is sent back to the initiator and the process ends for the recipient.
     - If accepted, the process continues.
3. Care Delivery
   - Perform Procedure, Care and Advice – The referred care is delivered. 
   - A Consultation Note is generated.
   - Send [Consultation Note [PCC-59]](A04.html) – The note is sent back to the referral initiator. 
   - Decision: Discharge?
     - If no, the cycle continues with further care and documentation.
     - If yes:
       - Prepare Discharge Report – A report is created. 
       - Send [Discharge Report [PCC-57]](A03.html) – The report is sent to the initiator. 
       - Process Discharge Report – The initiator processes the discharge information.
4. End Event
   - The process concludes when the discharge report is processed.




## Options

The different options include the use of the following archetypes. The differing formats are generally compatible with each other.

| Message (IHE 360X CDA/FHIR Document)   | HL7 v2                                                                                                            | HL7 FHIR Message                                                  | HL7 FHIR Resource                               |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Referral Request [PCC-55]](I12.html)  | [REF_I12](https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.5.1/TriggerEvents/REF_I12) Patient referral                | [Patient Referral I12](MessageDefinition-patient-referral.html)   | [ServiceRequest](StructureDefinition-ServiceRequest.html)                              |

### Traditional Messaging Option

<figure>
{%include eReferral-sequence.svg%}
<p id="fX.X.X.X-X" class="figureTitle">eReferral and eDischarge Sequence Diagram</p>
</figure>
<br clear="all">

With this option the requests are sent between the referral initiator and recipients.

#### Pros and Cons

- Follows International standards. 
  - The FHIR Messages mentioned above are not part of an international standard.
- The HL7 v2 ADT interactions are common in secondary but not so in other care settings. 
  - ADT is often used for **event notifications** with no clinical content. The clinical content is often shared via clinical documents (see next option) 
- Is an entry point standard which replaces email + pdf
- The referral acceptance/rejection (REF_I15) is often not implemented.
- The referral request, consultation note and discharge report are not shared with other care providers.
- Would likely make use of old pipe+hat and XML formats which can cause implementation difficulties.
- Data semantics around workflow are at present weak (all message formats), in particular this includes:
  - use of business identifiers
  - use of clinical coding
- This is not supported in UK HL7 standards (including UKCore).

#### Notes

1. The Referral Request is similar to:
    2. NHS England [Booking and Referral Standard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/booking-and-referral-standard) **FHIR Message**
2. Consultation Note and Discharge Report are similar to:
    3. NHS England [GP Connect and IM1](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect) Send Document, Update Record, and IM1 Write back operations.
    4. NHS England [Transfer of Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/transfer-of-care-initiative) **FHIR Document**
    5. NHS England [Digital Medicines](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-medicine-fhir) **FHIR Document**

### Event Notifications and Shared Data/Documents Option

Both the referral initiator and recipient share the referral letter, consultation note and discharge report using API's. Instead of transferring data they communicate via event notifications.

<figure>
{%include eReferral-xds-sequence.svg%}
</figure>
<br clear="all">

#### Message Exchange Flow

1. Referral Request (PCC-55)
   - The Referral Initiator sends a referral document (PCC-55) to the Enterprise Document/Data Sharing system.
2. REF_I12 Command Message
   - A control message (based on HL7 v2 or FHIR message standards) is sent to notify the system about the new document or data.
3. Retrieve Referral Request (PCC-55)
   - The Referral Recipient then pulls or retrieves the actual Referral Request (PCC-55) from the Enterprise Document/Data Sharing system.

#### Pros and Cons

- The command/document message is reused from the traditional messaging approach but without the clinical detail which simplifies the conversations.
- Data or Document Sharing Options
  - When sharing via documents, a central EDMS system such as [IHE XDS](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html) or EDMS with standard API's such as [IHE MHD](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/index.html) (note: IHE XDS can be used with MHD).
    - The format of the documents may be PDF, CDA or [FHIR Document](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documents.html)
  - When sharing data, the referral initiator and recipient should share the content via standard API's such as [IHE QEDm](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/QEDm/)/[FHIR REST](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html) Query API. 
- The method of sharing the data/document will vary, modern EPR suppliers are likely to favour IHE QEDm/FHIR REST. Many NHS Trusts are now sharing documents internally using EDMS, these are most often PDF documents.
- The referral acceptance/rejection (REF_I15) is often not implemented.

#### Notes

1. This is similar to the approach used in NHS England [e-Referral Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir)

### Shared Repositories and FHIR Workflow Option

<figure>
{%include eReferral-fhir-sequence.svg%}
</figure>
<br clear="all">

#### Pros and Cons

- This gives EHR/EPR full control of the data they create and so reduces data duplication. Access controls can be applied locally.
  - This level is sharing using FHIR REST Query API is already supported by several EPRs.
- The uptake of FHIR Workflow by existing vendors is likely to be low as they will often have equivalent alternatives. 
- A modern alternative to a traditional message, which supports modern transport and payload standards. 
- This is considerably different to common technical patterns which may not be understood by a non-technical audience, which imply a level of technical debt around the delivery of this.
- The FHIR Task and Encounter can be delivered via [FHIR Subscription](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/index.html) which is likely to be the preferred method (not FHIR RESTful in enterprise interactions due to scaling issues).
