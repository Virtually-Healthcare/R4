##### Notes

   2. NHS England [Booking and Referral Standard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/booking-and-referral-standard) **FHIR Message**
   3. NHS England [e-Referral Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir) 
2. Consultation Note and Discharge Report are similar to:
   3. NHS England [GP Connect and IM1](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect) Send Document, Update Record, and IM1 Write back operations.
   4. NHS England [Transfer of Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/transfer-of-care-initiative) **FHIR Document**

##### Pros and Cons

- Follows International standards. 
  - The FHIR Messages mentioned above are not part of an international standard.
- The HL7 v2 ADT interactions are common in secondary but not so in other care settings. 
  - ADT is often used for **event notifications** with no clinical content. The clinical content is often shared via clinical documents (see next option) 
- Is an entry point standard which replaces email + pdf
- The referral acceptance/rejection (REF_I15) is often not implemented.
