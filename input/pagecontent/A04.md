Shared Patient Records has two main catgeories:

- [Patient Summary](StructureDefinition-PatientSummary.html) which is often presented as a clinical document and this is broken down into document sections 
- **Patient Record Detail** which gives deeper insight into the patient's health and is often queryable.

Most electronic patient records (EPR) are structured similarly around the entities listed under Patient Record Detail.

Virtually uses a variety of interfaces to access data for both the Patient Summary and Patient Record Detail. Due to information governance such as user type (patient, pharmacist, GP, admin, etc) and organisation/care setting, which interfaces can be used varies.  

| Interface                           | Type    | Access                 | Notes                                                                            |
