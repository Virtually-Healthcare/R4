Shared Patient Records has two main catgeories:

- [Patient Summary](StructureDefinition-PatientSummary.html) which is often presented as a clinical document and this is broken down into document sections 
- **Patient Record Detail** which gives deeper insight into the patient's health and is often queryable.

Most electronic patient records (EPR) are structured similarly around the entities listed under Patient Record Detail.

Virtually uses a variety of interfaces to access data for both the Patient Summary and Patient Record Detail. Due to information governance such as user type (patient, pharmacist, GP, admin, etc) and organisation/care setting, which interfaces can be used varies.  

| Interface                                      | Type    | Access                 | API                                                                                                                    | Notes                                                                            |

All the external interfaces we use are facaded to use HL7 FHIR RESTful APIs to give consistent access to the data and are adapted to use the same [Canonical Data Model](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CanonicalDataModel.html) which is detailed in this implementation guide as [Resource Profiles](artifacts.html#5).
Where practical, we have also followed international best practice in particular:

- Patient Summary 
  - HL7 [International Patient Summary (IPS)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/index.html)
  - IHE [Sharing of IPS (sIPS)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/sIPS/index.html)
- Patient Record Detail (note these APIs are similar and may merge in the future)
  - patient record access: HL7 [International Patient Access (IPA)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa/)
  - practitioner record access: IHE [Query for Existing Data for Mobile (QEDm)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/QEDm/branches/master/index.html)
