Shared Patient Records has two main catgeories:

- [Patient Summary](StructureDefinition-PatientSummary.html) which is often presented as a clinical document and this is broken down into document sections 
- **Patient Record Detail** which gives deeper insight into the patient's health and is often queryable.

Most electronic patient records (EPR) are structured similarly around the entities listed under Patient Record Detail.
